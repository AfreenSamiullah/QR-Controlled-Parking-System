# QR-Controlled-Parking-System
An automated parking management system using IR sensors to trigger dynamic QR code generation (Python), LoRa-enabled communication between Arduino and ESP32-CAM for QR decoding/validation, and servo-actuated parking slots that open/close based on entry-exit scans, optimizing space utilization through real-time slot tracking.
